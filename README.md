This Objective-C/Cocoa wrapper implements the logic for AOL's openAIM WIM protocol. Protocol documentation and AIM Network license requirements can be located at http://developer.aim.com

Update New code drop includes numerous bug fixes, as well as moving to a delegate pattern for AIM host responses to commands (instead of using Notifications).

Update Project for WIMFramework also should build the Test Harness app - should make it easier for folks to test the Framework.

Description
If you want to integrate AIM into your Objective-C based application, this project is meant to make it easier for you. We're using it ourselves to build some AIM experiences.

This library is just beginning. We will be continuing to make available enhancements. The Framework concentrates on making the WIM AIM server protocol easier to consume. It does not make any assumptions about user interface.

Take it for a spin - give us your feedback about what you'd like to see (or if you'd like to contribute).
